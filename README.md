# py-hydrocapt

This is a simple Python wrapper to access your Diffazur Hydrocapt equiped pool. 
[Hydrocapt](https://www.hydrocapt.fr/).
I'm not affiliated in any way to Diffazut/Hydrocapt and their respective are brands. It is just an hobbyist project to control my Pool from homeassistant :)

It supports only one pool per account for now.
